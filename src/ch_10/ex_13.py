# installing packages just for yourself

"""
Python has a per-user installation directory thatâ€™s typically located in a directory such
as ~/.local/lib/python3.3/site-packages. To force packages to install in this directory,
give the --user option to the installation command. For example:
"""

# python3 setup.py install --user
# or
# pip install --user packagename
