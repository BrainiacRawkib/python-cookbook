# creating a new python environment

# to create a virtual environment, use:

# python -m venv env (where env is the name of the virtual env dir)

# after creating a virtual env, you can now install a package manager like

# pip or distribute

# * If you would like to include already installed packages as part of a
# virtual environment, create the environment using
# the "--system-site-packages" option"

# python -m venv --system-site-packages env
